# SQL-for-Data-Analys

 This project queries from a digital music store database called "chinook.db" that holds information regarding the storeâ€™s media, employees, and customers. 
To help the store gain an understanding of the types of music that are purchased, where customers live, and how the company might optimize its business practices, five questions were quired and plotted using Matplotlib library in "Sql.ipynb" file.
